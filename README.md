# Elevator-Control
Windows Form Application written in C# using Visual Studio 15

Using Object-Orintated Programming I developed a application which mimics an elevator. 
When the Request buttons are pressed the elevation moves to the desired floor and open the doors, using a timer
to animate the movement. The application is also connected to an Access database to log the movements of the elevator.
